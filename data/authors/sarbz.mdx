## About Me 👨‍💻

Hello <span className="wave">👋</span>  
I'm `Abdul Rafay Zahid`, a technology enthusiast with a deep love for programming. I have a passion for working on impactful and meaningful technology, and I love sharing my insights and exploration of cutting-edge technology with others.

Some highlights of my work:
- Shipped an enterprise networking solution to customers with tens of millions of users
- Revamped food delivery platform with real-time tracking, GenAI-powered dietary tagging, and complex payment infrastructure
- Designed and developed sophisticated recommendation system in NextJS leveraging RAG architecture and OpenAI embeddings to analyze user profiles and match them with optimal scholarships and colleges

### Tech Stack I'm familiar with:

<FamiliarTechStack />

### Professional Experience 💼

I've had the opportunity to work across diverse roles in software engineering, from building scalable web platforms to architecting AI-powered systems. Currently at **Softaims**, I work on full-stack development with NextJS and FastAPI, building recommendation systems with RAG architecture and LLM-powered feedback tools. Previously at **Ebryx**, I focused on systems programming in C++ and Python, optimizing networking components and re-architecting policy engines for a zero-trust security platform. I also built data pipeline infrastructure for dynamically assessing risk scores, integrating ML models to analyze access patterns using Kafka streams. I've also contributed to projects involving OCR pipelines, ElasticSearch integration, and cloud deployments with Docker and Kubernetes during my time at **Active Takeoff**, **Systems Limited**, and **PITB**.

### Education 🎓

**Bachelors in Computer Science** - [2020 - 2024]

- @ `FAST NUCES`, Lahore, Pakistan
- Coursework includes:
  - Information Retrieval
  - Computer Vision
  - Parallel and Distributed Computing
  - Advanced Database Concepts

  For my Final Year Project, I developed an **Emotion Recognition System** utilizing `PyTorch` and `OpenCV`. The project applied computer vision concepts including facial detection, feature extraction, and deep learning-based classification to identify human emotions from video streams in real-time.

#### Leadership Experience 🎯

**Softec, FAST NUCES** — Deputy Head of Conferences 2022
- Hosted the largest tech conference in Pakistan, liaising with industry leaders
- Delegated and managed a large team of volunteers and staff members for the duration of the event

**World Affairs Society, Karachi Grammar School** — Founder and President
- Initiated and established the society, launching its flagship event, Renaissance 19
- Coordinated and executed plans for events, including inviting speakers and managing logistics
